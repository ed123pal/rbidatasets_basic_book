    "text": "Students learning R need accessible data to hone their coding skills. In theory, R provides this through its many built‑in datasets. In practice, however, working with these datasets isn’t always as simple as it sounds.\nI wrote this book to close this gap between theory and reality.\nR offers multiple ways to access and handle built-in datasets. Many of those approaches assume familiarity with packages, environments, and memory management. Often, these are skills beginners have not yet gained. This book removes that early complexity by giving you a clear, guided path to the essential techniques for working with R’s built‑in datasets.",

This book is designed to remove that friction.\nIt won’t turn you into an expert, but it will give you the practical skills you need to become confident and capable. Along the way, you’ll build a solid foundation that makes deeper exploration easier whenever you’re ready for it.\nThe approach is simple: Show, then Tell. Usually, you’ll see an idea demonstrated in real code first, and only then will I break down how and why it works.\nChapters 1 - 3\nThese chapters introduce the essentials of working with built‑in datasets, using examples from three popular R packages.\nYou’ll learn how to find, load, and explore datasets so you can start working with them immediately.\nChapter 4\nThis chapter presents a streamlined workflow that ties together the techniques from earlier chapters.\nThink of it as a quick‑reference guide you can return to whenever you need a refresher.\nChapter 5\nA bonus chapter that highlights several widely used datasets, explaining what makes them so popular and how they’re typically applied.\nConclusion\nWraps up your learning about the basics. It also suggests next steps, which includes describing an upcoming companion book titled, R Built-in Datasets: Advanced Concepts.",

This interpretation also sometime refers to datasets contained in other packages as “package-specific” datasets.\nAn increasing common, more liberal, interpretation of “built-in” is that datasets contain in any R package (e.g. starwars) can be referred to as “built-in” since they are literally built into the package. This book uses this more open interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Other key points\n\nThe datasets package is unique among R packages.\nIts primary purpose is to provide datasets for learning and practicing R.\nThe datasets package is installed with R and is automatically available in every R session.\nThe datasets package provides the data() function, which can be used with any package to load a dataset into the global environment\nYou can also use data() to list the publicly available datasets contained in a package.",

These packages are referred to as recommended packages. They are high-quality, widely-used packages the R Core Team considers essential for most users. The MASS package is a famous example of this type of package. Others include lattice, mgcv and nlme. Below are details about MASS.\n\n5.3.1 MASS\nHere, I want to point out the MASS package because there’s sometimes confusion about this package for a couple of reasons.\nOften, people will refer to a “MASS” dataset, but it’s not a dataset. Rather, MASS is a package that contains datasets. This is similar to how the datasets package contains many datasets.\nWhat’s important to know is the MASS package contains both datasets and functions. Specifically, it contains modern versions of many functions that were previously used from the base R stats package. Think of stats as the (legacy) standard toolbox package and MASS as the professional upgrade. It’s designed to handle messy, real-world data that violates the strict assumptions of classical statistics.\nThe MASS package is a recommended package, meaning it’s installed with base R, but you’ll need to run library(MASS) to make it available to your R session.\nBelow a few of the most frequently used MASS datasets:\n\nCars93: Data on 93 car models from 1993.\nmammals: Brain and body weights for 62 species of land mammals.\nbirthwt: Risk factors associated with low infant birth weight.\ncrabs: Morphological measurements of Leptograpsus crabs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Boston dataset was historically the most famous MASS dataset, but it was removed due to ethical concerns regarding the use of variables involving racial proportions. If needed, it can be found in the ISLR2 and spdep packages.\nI’ve included this callout to draw attention that it’s sometimes appropriate to consider the source and content of data in built-in datasets.",

    "title": "5  Popular datasets",
    "section": "5.4 Add-on packages",
    "text": "5.4 Add-on packages\nPackages that are not categorized as base or recommended are referred to as add-on packages. These packages are not part of the standard R installation. The most likely source for these packages is CRAN, but some are sourced from other places such as Bioconductor or various GitHub repositories.\nBased on use patterns in multiple learning resources, several datasets contained in R add-on packages, such as the ones listed below, are also very popular.\n\n5.4.1 penguins\nPackage: palmerpenguins\nDescription: Size measurements (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass) for 344 penguins representing three species (Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\nPopularity: It was specifically designed as a modern, more ethically sound, and approachable replacement for the iris dataset. It is popular because it includes missing values (NAs) and more obvious species clusters, making it perfect for teaching data cleaning and visualization.\n\n\n5.4.2 diamonds\nPackage: ggplot2\nDescription: This dataset contains the prices and other attributes (carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions) of nearly 54,000 round-cut diamonds.\nPopularity: It is the primary dataset used to teach ggplot2. Because of its relatively large size (~54k rows), it is excellent for showing how to handle overplotting, identifying non-linear relationships, and demonstrating the impact of categorical variables on price.\n\n\n5.4.3 flights\nPackage: nycflights13\nDescription: On-time data for all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City (JFK, LGA, EWR) in 2013. It is often used alongside other tables in the nycflights13 package like weather, planes, and airports.\nPopularity: It is the “go-to” dataset for teaching data wrangling with dplyr. Its massive scale and relational structure (requiring joins between different tables) make it ideal for learning how to manipulate, filter, and summarize complex real-world data.\n\n\n5.4.4 gapminder\nPackage: gapminder\nDescription: An excerpt of the Gapminder data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population by country and continent over time (from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years).\nPopularity: Made famous by Hans Rosling’s TED talks, this dataset is widely used to teach time-series visualization and animation (using gganimate). It helps users understand how to map aesthetics like size and color to multiple dimensions of data.\n\n\n5.4.5 ISLR\nPackages: ISLR and ISLR2\nDescription: Wage and other health/demographic data for 3,000 male workers in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US.\nPopularity: As the companion dataset for the influential book An Introduction to Statistical Learning, it is the standard for teaching regression modeling, splines, and cross-validation. It provides a realistic scenario for predicting a continuous variable (income) using a mix of numerical and categorical predictors.\n\n\n5.4.6 starwars\nWhile the starwars dataset is technically an add-on dataset, it can also be referred to as a “special-interest” dataset.\nSometimes you’ll be drawn to a specific add-on dataset due to special personal or professional interests. For example, many people became fans of the Starwars franchise early in life so working with data about its characters is fun for them as adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInformation is given below for two special-interest datasets. Significant details are provided here as an example of how an LLM (in this case Gemini) can be used to provide a detailed description a dataset.\nA key point that becomes clear below is that datasets in the auk package are unlike most built-in datasets because auk is well-maintained and is used for serious research (even though it can also be used for practicing R coding).\n\n\nPackage:\ndplyr\nDescription:\nThe starwars dataset is a tibble (a modern version of a data frame) containing information on characters from the Star Wars films. It includes 14 variables:\nPhysical Traits: Name, height (cm), mass (kg), hair color, skin color, and eye color.\nDemographics: Birth year, biological sex, gender, and homeworld.\nSpecies: The species of the character (e.g., Human, Droid, Wookiee).\nList-Columns: This is its most unique feature. It contains three columns (films, vehicles, and starships) where each “cell” actually contains a list of items rather than a single value.\nPopularity:\nThe starwars dataset isn’t just popular because people like the Starwars movies; it is strategically designed to teach modern data science workflows that older datasets like iris simply cannot handle.\nTeaching “List-Columns”\nMost traditional datasets are “flat” (one value per cell). However, in the real world, data is often nested (like JSON). Because a character like Obi-Wan Kenobi appears in multiple films and flies multiple starships, those columns contain lists. This makes starwars the gold standard for teaching the nest(), unnest(), and purrr map functions.\nMastering Categorical Data\nThe dataset contains many categorical variables with many levels (like homeworld or species). It is excellent for practicing with the forcats package, providing a chance to learn how to lump rare categories together (e.g., “Other”) or reorder factors for better visualization.\nReal-World “Messiness”\nUnlike the perfectly curated iris dataset, starwars is intentionally “messy”:\nMissing Values (NAs): Droids like R2-D2 don’t have “hair color” or a “birth year,” and Jabba the Hutt doesn’t have a “gender” in the same way humans do. This forces students to learn how to handle NA values using filter() or replace_na().\nVariable Types: It includes character strings, numbers, and lists, providing a comprehensive workout for data cleaning.\n\n\n5.4.7 ebird_taxonomy\nAnother example of a special-interest dataset is the ebird_taxonomy dataset.\nPackage:\nauk\nDescription:\nThis dataset provides a complete list of all bird species and recognizable forms (subspecies, hybrids, etc.) recognized by the Clements Checklist, which is the global taxonomic standard used by eBird.\nIt typically contains several key variables:\n\nspecies_code: The unique, alphanumeric code for every bird (e.g., barswa for Barn Swallow). This is the “primary key” used to link datasets.\nscientific_name: The Latin name (e.g., Hirundo rustica).\ncommon_name: The English name used by birders.\nTaxonomic Hierarchy: Columns for Order (e.g., Passeriformes) and Family (e.g., Hirundinidae), allowing users to group birds by biological relationship.\nreport_as: A critical column that helps “roll up” complex sightings (like subspecies) into a single species level for cleaner analysis.\n\nPopularity:\nThe popularity of ebird_taxonomy stems from the fact that eBird is one of the largest biodiversity data sources in existence, with over a billion bird observations worldwide.\nThe “Dictionary” for Big Data\nThe raw eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) is massive (terabytes in size) and often uses codes instead of names to save space. Scientists and hobbyists use ebird_taxonomy as a look-up table to turn those cryptic codes into readable species names or to filter their data by specific families (e.g., “Show me all hawks and eagles”).\nSolving the “Naming” Problem\nCommon names for birds change frequently, and different regions use different names for the same bird. This dataset provides the official, standardized mapping. It ensures that if one researcher calls a bird a “Common Eider” and another uses the Latin name, the auk package can reconcile them perfectly.\nFiltering Specialized Observations\neBird data is “noisy.” It contains records of hybrids, “slashes” (e.g., “Slaty-backed/Vega Gull”), and domestic birds. The ebird_taxonomy dataset allows researchers to quickly filter for “species” only, removing the ambiguous entries that might skew statistical results in a population study.\nSpatial and Temporal Integration\nBecause the taxonomy is updated annually, this dataset is the key to maintaining long-term consistency. When species are “split” (one species becomes two) or “lumped” by taxonomists, this dataset helps R users update their historical data to match modern scientific standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAgain, a reminder about why auk datasets are truly an example of a distinguished set of special interest datasets:\nThe auk package is renowned for its use in ornithology. It has more than just the ebird_taxonomy datasets as well as important functions for performing data analysis.\nWhile many (likely most) of the built-in datasets you’ll use will be “play” datasets for learning R, datasets in the auk package are examples of of how some datasets contained in R packages are used for serious research.",
